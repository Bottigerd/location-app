I literally have one called ‘Jimbo Jones’, it’s profile picture is of Jimbo Jones from the Simpsons. Another even says they have never been in the store.

            "text" : "Pathetic service by google. My business profile was suspended without me knowing the reasons behind the suspension. When contacted google staff, i was told they don't know the reason for suspension and that i should submit a reinstatement form. After filling out the reinstatement form, i again get a response that i don't meeting listing requirements. A verified business listing that has been in place for last 6 years suddenly doesn't meet listing requirements is hard to digest. Google gave me hard time even at the time of verification despite that fact that my listing was on google for a couple of years. I cannot comprehend why google was sleeping and suddenly they realized that they have to verify a business that is on the listing for a couple of years. After spending numerous hours trying to resolve the issue, i have hit a dead end. I don't know what to do. When i asked google call center employee to provide with an address where i can serve legal notice,  i was told that they don't know the address for serving legal notices. What kind of services google is offering if their employees don't know basic stuff to assist customers. Until my business profile was suspended i had a smooth ride with google but this is now becoming a nightmare. Either provide specific details about reasons for suspension or not suspend profiles - this is my feedback. I am very stressed about this situation and just don't know what to do. I don't even have the address to serve legal notice to google.",
